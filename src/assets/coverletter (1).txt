Appoint Recruit

Brisbane QLD

Re: Application for Junior to Mid Level Software Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Junior to Mid Level Software Engineer position at the Brisbane-based company you're representing. As a final-year Bachelor of Computer Science student with hands-on project experience and a relentless drive to learn, I'm eager to contribute my skills and passion to a team that thrives on solving complex problems.

While I may be relatively new to the professional software development world, my academic projects and freelance work have provided me with valuable experience in building full-stack applications. I'm proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I have hands-on experience with frontend technologies like React and backend technologies like Node.js and Express. I'm also comfortable working with SQL databases, which aligns well with the requirements of this role.

I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to work alongside highly skilled senior engineers and contribute to high-data-driven projects. I'm a fast learner with a strong work ethic and a passion for continuous improvement. I'm confident that my eagerness to learn and grow, coupled with my existing skills, will enable me to quickly become a valuable asset to the team.

I'm also excited about the prospect of working in a collaborative environment where I can contribute to the entire development lifecycle, from planning and coding to testing and deployment. I'm a detail-oriented individual who thrives under pressure, and I'm committed to delivering high-quality work that meets the company's standards.

Although I may not have extensive commercial experience with .NET Core or Azure, I'm a fast learner and I'm confident in my ability to quickly upskill in these areas. I'm eager to embrace new challenges and contribute to the company's growth and success.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm an Australian citizen and I'm available for an immediate start. I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss how my skills, passion, and dedication can make a positive impact on your team.

Sincerely,

Rohaan Ahmed
