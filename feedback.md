  - login needs page refresh
  - chat needs refresh to correctly render
  - chat leaks into other channels
  - channels need auto selection

-
- spacing is too open
- borders need more pronunciation
- profile hover fluid timeframe animations
- commandline on top of the page
  - message @ moey : "hello"
  - jump @ gaming
  - call @ moey
  - voice_message @ moey
  - invite @ moey
  - impliment autocomplete
- ai
  - learn user personal behavior using gpt
  - map contexts such as "go to moey" -> goes to moey chat or just "moey" and enters moey dms
