# Real‑World Auth & Architecture Comparison (Plain‑English Guide)

This guide explains how your current approach compares with common, battle‑tested patterns. It uses simple language and short definitions for tricky terms.

---

## Quick glossary (lightweight definitions)

- Single source of truth: Only one place in your app that decides “what is the current auth state?”. This avoids conflicts.
- Side effect: Any action that touches the outside world (API call, navigation, timers, logging). In React, keep these in `useEffect`, not during render.
- Interceptor (Axios): A hook that runs before a request or after a response. Often used to attach tokens or catch 401 errors.
- SPA navigation: Navigating inside a single‑page app using the router (e.g., `navigate()`), not full page reloads (`window.location`).
- Bearer token: The standard way to send tokens: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- httpOnly cookie: A cookie not readable by JavaScript (safer against XSS). Alternative to storing tokens in `localStorage`.
- Split‑brain state: The same piece of state is tracked in two places (e.g., Redux + Context). They can drift out of sync and cause bugs.

## 1) Single source of truth for auth

- What you did:
  - Auth is tracked in both Context (`src/utils/AuthContext.tsx`) and Redux (`userSlice.isAuthenticated`). Route guards use Context, but the Context provider isn’t globally mounted.
- How it’s done in the real world:
  - Pick one system (Context or Redux) for auth. Mount it once at the root so every component sees a consistent value.
- Why it matters:
  - Fewer bugs, easier mental model, simpler tests and refactors.
- Fix checklist:
  - Mount `AuthProvider` at app root.
  - Remove `isAuthenticated` from Redux (or stop reading it anywhere).
  - Ensure all route guards and login/logout read from the same Context.

## 2) Side effects belong in effects, not render

- What you did:
  - `ProtectedRoute` dispatches thunks inside render using an IIFE; this can run on every render and spam the API.
- Real‑world approach:
  - Do data fetching and other side effects inside `useEffect` with clear dependency arrays.
- Why it matters:
  - Prevents duplicate requests, flakiness, and hard‑to‑trace race conditions.
- Fix checklist:
  - Move post‑login data fetching to a `useEffect` that runs once when `isAuthenticated` becomes true.

## 3) HTTP/auth boundaries (interceptor responsibilities)

- What you did:
  - Set `Authorization = token` (no `Bearer `). Redirect to login from the interceptor. No guard for network errors (no `err.response`).
- Real‑world approach:
  - Set header as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  - Interceptor signals auth failure (e.g., calls a logout callback) but does not perform navigation.
  - Guard network errors before reading `err.response.status`.
- Why it matters:
  - Standard compatibility with servers; cleaner layering; fewer crashy edge cases offline.
- Fix checklist:
  - Add `Bearer` prefix, null‑check `err.response`, call `auth.logout()` rather than `window.location` in the interceptor.

## 4) Storage, expiry, and consistency

- What you did:
  - Mixed keys: `expire` vs `token-expire`. Sometimes you remove only one of them. You verify token before persisting it, so the interceptor may not attach it.
- Real‑world approach:
  - Use consistent keys and write token first.
  - Update axios defaults immediately after login.
  - Track expiry (epoch ms) and set a timer to logout or refresh.
  - Let the server validate the token; don’t send client‑side `expire` for trust.
- Why it matters:
  - Predictable behavior across refreshes/tabs; fewer “ghost sessions”.
- Fix checklist:
  - Pick `token` and `tokenExpiresAt` (ms) as keys.
  - On login: persist → set axios header → set state → navigate.
  - On logout/invalid: clear both keys in one place.
  - Add a `storage` event listener to sync logout/login across tabs.

## 5) Routing and page reloads

- What you did:
  - Use `window.location.href/assign` in multiple places.
- Real‑world approach:
  - Use React Router’s `navigate` or `<Navigate />` for SPA transitions.
- Why it matters:
  - Keeps app state intact, faster UX, easier to reason about flows.
- Fix checklist:
  - Replace all `window.location.*` with router navigation.

## 6) Naming/typing and Context safety

- What you did:
  - `checkTokenExpired` name vs return value don’t align; uses numeric truthiness with a bitwise bug. `isAuthenticated` typed as `boolean | null` but used as boolean. `useAuth()` may return `undefined` if provider is missing.
- Real‑world approach:
  - Use boolean contracts for validation helpers.
  - Keep `isAuthenticated` strictly boolean; use a separate `authLoading` for “unknown yet”.
  - In `useAuth()`, throw a clear error if used outside the provider.
- Why it matters:
  - Clear intent reduces cognitive load and subtle bugs.
- Fix checklist:
  - Rename to `isTokenValid()` and return boolean.
  - Guard `useAuth()` to throw if context is undefined.

## 7) Observability and logging

- What you did:
  - Verbose `console.log` in auth flows; some logs risk leaking sensitive info.
- Real‑world approach:
  - Minimal logs, no secrets, and optional debug logs behind a flag.
- Why it matters:
  - Security hygiene and cleaner consoles in production.
- Fix checklist:
  - Remove token/expire logs; add a simple `DEBUG` flag and conditional logging if needed.

## 8) WebSocket lifecycle

- What you did:
  - Start a worker for WebSocket; unclear token attach/teardown.
- Real‑world approach:
  - Start sockets only when authenticated; include token (query param or subprotocol) if required; teardown on logout.
- Why it matters:
  - Prevents unauthorized connections and stale listeners.
- Fix checklist:
  - Connect after auth, pass token safely, and terminate on logout.

## 9) Developer experience (DX) and structure

- What you did:
  - AuthContext under `utils/`; mixed `.jsx` with TS; scattered magic strings (keys, route paths).
- Real‑world approach:
  - Place providers under `providers/` or `context/`.
  - Use consistent TS (`.tsx`) or intentionally isolate JS.
  - Centralize constants for keys and endpoints.
- Why it matters:
  - Faster onboarding (even for future‑you), fewer typos, easier global changes.
- Fix checklist:
  - Move files to predictable locations; create a `constants.ts`; standardize file extensions.

## Suggested order to apply changes (low risk → higher impact)

1. Mount `AuthProvider` at root and remove Redux auth state.
2. Normalize storage keys and fix login/logout sequence (persist first; navigate with router).
3. Harden axios interceptor (Bearer + guards) and delegate 401 handling to `auth.logout()`.
4. Move post‑login data fetching into `useEffect` (no side effects in render).
5. Remove sensitive logs; centralize constants.
6. WebSocket: attach token and teardown on auth changes; add multi‑tab sync via `storage` events.

This path keeps changes controlled and makes auth reliable without a big rewrite. Once stable, you can consider advanced options like httpOnly cookies or refresh tokens.
